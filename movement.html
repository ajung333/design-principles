     <h1>Principle No. 4: Movement</h1>
              <h2>What is Movement?</h2>

     <p>Good design controls the order in which we look at things. The flow of lines creates movement, because it moves the eye across the screen or page. Horizontal lines communicate the flow from left to right or right to left. Vertical lines communicate stability, inspirational upward movement or downward movement. Diagonal lines communicate exciting dynamic movement and two converging diagonal lines communicate distance. Curving lines communicates distance or meandering movement. You want movement and flow to direct the eyes across the layout to convey information and evoke emotion. Be wary of overuse of lines, because it can take away from the design and interrupt the viewerâ€™s flow. (Golombisky, Kim, and Rebecca Hagen. White Space Is Not Your Enemy: a Beginner's Guide to Communicating Visually through Graphic, Web &amp; Multimedia Design. Focal Press/Elsevier, 2010, pp. 53.)</p>
       <p>Movement is the principle that an effective and well-thought out design controls the way in which we look at each element of the layout. Different lines create movement and communicates different meanings.</p> 
    <ul>
       <li>Horizontal lines: Movement flows from left to right or right to left</li>
        <li>Vertical lines: Flows upwards and communicates stability and inspirational movement upwards or downwards movement</li>
        <li>Diagonal lines: Communicates dynamic movement and two converging lines can communicate distance</li>
        <li>Curving lines: Communicates distance or meandering movement</li>
       </ul>
       <p>While using lines are very effective, be cautious of using too much, because it can distract the viewer and disrupt the flow. You want smooth flow to convey information and also invoke emotion.</p>
    <p>Movement is extremely important in photography. Paying attention to lines and where they lead can really affect a photo. It is important to know what kind of emotion you want to invoke and how you will achieve that through the image. For example, if you want to project serenity or calmness, something like a picture of mountains with tall trees can do that. If you want to project a sense of adventure, taking a picture of a road or a path leading to somewhere unknown can achieve that feeling in the viewer. It is important to take feelings into account and know how you can invoke what you want in the audience.</p>
