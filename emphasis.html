     <p>According to White Space is Not Your Enemy by Golombisky and Hagen, emphasis or focal point “is the visual center of attention in the design or layout because it focuses on the eye’s attention.” It is considered the most visually important thing on any layout and is the center of attention. You must have a focal point to capture the viewer’s attention. In addition, limit yourself to only one on the screen or page to be front and center (Golombisky, Kim, and Rebecca Hagen. White Space Is Not Your Enemy: a Beginner's Guide to Communicating Visually through Graphic, Web &amp; Multimedia Design. Focal Press/Elsevier, 2010, pp. 50-51.)</p>
       <p>A focal point is a crucial piece to the works-every-time layout. Without it, viewers do not know where to look first, so it is important to focus the viewer’s attention. In order to have a proper focal point, you must only have one and have it be the most visually eye-catching. You can achieve this by adjusting the size of the image or even contrasting it to other elements of the layout.</p>
       <p>As someone who likes to create and make things, focal point is something I have to take into consideration in order for anything to look good. Without a strong focal point, there is no flow to the project and it distracts the viewer from the overall design, because they do not know where to look first. Whether it is a painting or even a photo, there must be something that draws the eye immediately in order for the piece to be interesting and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
