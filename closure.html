     <p>We mentally fill in the gaps in order to complete a perceived shape. The idea of only designing a part of a widely known shape, but have the viewer perceive it as a whole open up interesting compositional opportunities. We can achieve this by playing with positive and negative space. (Golombisky, Kim, and Rebecca Hagen. White Space Is Not Your Enemy: a Beginner's Guide to Communicating Visually through Graphic, Web &amp; Multimedia Design. Focal Press/Elsevier, 2010, pp. 77.)</p>
    <p>In the same way that we follow a line with our eyes, we also perceive an incomplete shape as whole. Even if there is a lack of definite lines, we mentally close lines and see what is implied. By playing around with positive and negative space, we can achieve this effect. Artistically speaking, this opens up endless opportunities to create something interesting.</p>
    <p>When I am painting with watercolor, I love to use artist tape and block out portions of the page to create white space. This is similar to when you use tape to cover a windowsill, so you do not get paint on them. Because of the tape and the lack of color underneath, the brain sees it as white lines. There is something satisfying about seeing the lines of white midst of the colorful shapes.</p>
