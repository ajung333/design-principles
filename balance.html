     <h1>Principle No. 3: Balance</h1>
            <h2>What is Balance?</h2>

     <figcaption>This is an example of good usage of balance.

       <p>Balance can mean many things in different contexts, but in design, we think of it in terms of visual weight. The lack of balance can cause the viewer to feel unbalanced and even tense or anxious. The three kinds of visual balance are:
       <ul><li>Radial: Radial balance refers to circular designs in which the fulcrum lies at the center. It is the only type of balance that, when split, creates two symmetrical halves.</li>
           <li>Symmetrical: In order to achieve symmetrical balance or formal balance, each side of the design must mirror each other. This tends to be seen in more traditional and conservative designs.</li>
           <li>Asymmetrical: Asymmetry is the opposite of this. Each side of the design do not mirror each other and creates something visually interesting. Shifting the fulcrum to the left or right creates this asymmetry.</li></ul>
       
      <p>As mentioned in Contrast, you need contrasting elements in order to create interest, but this also deals with balance. You must have these elements in order to achieve balance in design. (Golombisky, Kim, and Rebecca Hagen. White Space Is Not Your Enemy: a Beginner's Guide to Communicating Visually through Graphic, Web &amp; Multimedia Design. Focal Press/Elsevier, 2010, pp. 51-52.)</p>
      <p>Balance can really make or break a design. Balance can invoke feelings of uncomfortableness if not done correctly. You want your audience to have positive feeling and focus on the message of the design instead of feeling uncomfortable just looking at it. The three kinds of visual balance are: radial, symmetrical, and asymmetrical. Radial balance deal with designs that are circular and can be split into symmetrical halves. Symmetrical balance tends to be used in more tradition or conservative designs. When bisected, the design is mirror halves of each other. In asymmetrical design, the fulcrum, or the center of visual gravity, is shifted either left or right and makes for a more visually interesting design. You must account for visual weight and making sure that is also balanced. This can be achieved in several different ways, such as, balancing the amount of filled space to empty space or dark tones to light tones.</p>
      <p>As mentioned in <a href="contrast.html">Contrast</a> you need dark and light tones in order to make something realistic, but it also is important in balance. You cannot have a painting with just dark tones. It would not look good and the colors would just mix together. Without lighter tones, it would be like trying to see something in a dark room. You need to have these lighter tones to see the object of the painting and also have a balanced visual weight.</p>
