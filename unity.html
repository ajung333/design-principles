     <h1>Principle No. 6: Unity</h1>
             <h2>What is Unity?</h2>

     <p>Unity means to have parts of the design work together and looks like they belong together. A layout is unified if all the parts are visually linked to one another. This means that each element of the design all have to do with each other. A good design contains: </p>
       <ul>
       <li>Consistency in the pattern of type columns</li>
       <li>Rhythm of typography</li>
        <li>Style of visuals</li>
        <li>etc..</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Unity in design means to have one cohesive design or visual message. (Golombisky, Kim, and Rebecca Hagen. White Space Is Not Your Enemy: a Beginner's Guide to Communicating Visually through Graphic, Web &amp; Multimedia Design. Focal Press/Elsevier, 2010, pp. 55.)</p>
       <p>When your design is visually appealing and all elements of it look like they belong together, you have achieved unity. A visually unified design has all of its different individual parts connect to each other. A good design means to have consistency in the legs of type, rhythm of the type, same style of images, and more. Once you have achieved this, it results in one cohesive layout.</p>
       <p>At the end of each work of art, every artist wants to see that their product has a sense of unification and completeness. Unity to me means that my vision has been realized in a way that my art piece conveys what I want to tell and every element of it is relevant to my vision. As an artist, my ultimate goal is to be satisfied with what I have created. In order to have that satisfaction, it needs to make sense and one can tell what I was trying to convey.</p>
