     <p>As humans, we perceive objects that are closely placed together as belonging in the same group. This is similar to the law of Common Fate, which states that we perceive objects moving in the same direction as part of the same group. This is also closely related to clumping in the sense that you want to avoid a cluttered layout, but rather grouping items together that relate to each other. (Golombisky, Kim, and Rebecca Hagen. White Space Is Not Your Enemy: a Beginner's Guide to Communicating Visually through Graphic, Web &amp; Multimedia Design. Focal Press/Elsevier, 2010, pp. 76.)</p>
    <p>Similar to the law of Common Fate, where we perceive things that are moving the same way as related to each other, humans automatically think that things that are close to each other as belonging to the same group. In design, you want to group things that are related close to each other. If this is done correctly, you avoid clumping, which is basically a cluttered layout with no sense of hierarchy.</p>
    <p>Sometimes there is so much that I want to put into an art piece, but it comes out looking cluttered and some parts do not make sense. Keeping it simple and using only things that are related can be difficult when you want to somehow to keep it all in there. It is most difficult when I have so many ideas, but taking things out is really difficult. However, it is crucial to keep only things that are relevant and utilize white space.</p>
