     <h1>Gesalt Theory Law No. 2: Similarity</h1>
        <h2>What is Similarity?</h2>

     <p>Our minds are wired to group items with similar properties, such as color or shape. Like the saying goes, “like goes with like.” Through this law and unity, we can use it to create order and organization. (Golombisky, Kim, and Rebecca Hagen. White Space Is Not Your Enemy: a Beginner's Guide to Communicating Visually through Graphic, Web &amp; Multimedia Design. Focal Press/Elsevier, 2010, pp. 76.)</p>
    <p>Similarly, to <a href="proximity.html">Proximity</a>, when we see things that are close in properties, like shape and color, we immediately think that they are related to one another. We can utilize this law in conjunction with unity and create an organized design. This can be achieved by using the same fonts, colors, and similar icons.</p>
    <p>Sometimes we want to use different fonts to create an interesting piece, however, it can distract from the main message. Using the same fonts and things that are similar to each other can make it look professional. This was especially my problem when I was younger. I always wanted to use all the fonts, because I thought they were pretty, but now that I am older, I like to use readable fonts and keep things simple.</p>
