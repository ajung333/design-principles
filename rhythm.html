     <p>Patterns create movement that can be called rhythm. In design, rhythmic movement means to repeat certain design elements repeatedly. This can be done by either repeating a color, an icon, establishing columns to keep legs of type uniform, grouping images, or repeating fonts. Visual rhythm creates a sense of togetherness, but also guides the eye from one element to another in a hierarchy. Patterns can either be regular or irregular. It does not have to be symmetrical.</p>
    <p>Patterns, regular or irregular, creates movement that is called rhythm. Rhythm is important, because it creates the feeling of completeness and helps the viewer know what to look at in succession. In design, rhythmic movement means to repeatedly use the same elements. There are many ways to create rhythm, such as repeated use of:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>Color</li>
         <li>Font</li>
         <li>Images</li>
     </ul>
    <p>Or using columns to create legs of text or grouping of images.(Golombisky, Kim, and Rebecca Hagen. White Space Is Not Your Enemy: a Beginner's Guide to Communicating Visually through Graphic, Web &amp; Multimedia Design. Focal Press/Elsevier, 2010, pp. 53-54.)</p>
    <p>In watercolor painting, I like to create patterns, mainly because I am not the best at drawing, but also because it gives me a sense of calm in my chaotic everyday life. It is also very simple to achieve, because all you have to do is repeat one thing over and over again to make a pattern. This is also true for the colors I use. Typically, I will stick to the same basic five or so colors. This allows for simplicity and unity, because by using the same basic colors, I can create dimension by playing with the color value. This is also true when I color in mandalas. Since they are basically a circular image of repeated patterns, using a specific color for a specific pattern creates a sense of completeness once I have finished coloring it in.
