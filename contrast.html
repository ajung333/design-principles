     <h1>Principle No. 2: Contrast</h1>

     <p>It is crucial to have contrast, because it creates an interesting layout. There are many ways to achieve contrast, because it offers a great deal of flexibility on what elements of the design you choose to contrast. Contrast in an effective design can look like contrasting lines or shapes, size of images, textures, color value, or even filled and empty space. There are many ways that you can create contrast just by juxtaposing different elements. (Golombisky, Kim, and Rebecca Hagen. White Space Is Not Your Enemy: a Beginner's Guide to Communicating Visually through Graphic, Web &amp; Multimedia Design. Focal Press/Elsevier, 2010, pp. 51.)</p>
     <p>Contrast is something that one does not really pay attention to, but is critical in every design. It draws the viewerâ€™s attention to the different aspects of the design and can also communicate a separation of each section. Without contrast, the audience would be visually bored and will not want to pay attention to what you have created. You have much flexibility in what contrasts in the layout as a creator, which allows for artistic freedom and the ability to play around and do something that someone else has not yet done.</p>
    <p>Whether it be a painting or a photo, contrast plays a huge part in each. For a painting, it is incredibly important to focus on the dark and light values. In real life, you can see this by looking at the lightest part of an object and the shade that results on the other side of that object. In order for something to look realistic, you must have those light and shade parts otherwise you will be left with a 2D image. In photography, the same basic principles apply in the sense that you have to adjust the settings manually in order to achieve a certain look that you are going for. This can be done by adjusting things like the aperture and shutter speed, which impacts the exposure time, which controls how light or dark the photo is.</p>
